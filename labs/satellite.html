      Thousands of satellites cross our sky every second. While some aim their instruments into the far-beyond, many of them are up there giving us amazing insight into the planet we call home. GPS, internet, and military satellitesâ€”historically, they transmitted their data to ground stations managed by governments, military, researchers, and meteorologists. But weather satellites, particularly those commissioned by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, were design to allow their data to be accessible to anyone with a cheap antenna and a tuneable radio.

      This lab documents my exploration into the NOAA-15, -18, and -19 satellites: the three remaining Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) still is use today. I share how I track their position, intercept their direct readouts, and decode their Automatic Picture Transmissions (APT) using open source hardware and software.
